# Custom External Slot Types

This repository holds JSON files for various custom slot types that are registered using the `ask smapi create-interaction-model-catalog` and `ask smapi create-interaction-model-catalog-version` commands. They may also be referenced by jobs created with `ask smapi create-job-definition-for-interaction-model`.

Put simply, this enables me to create custom slot types that can be reused across multiple skills and potentially updated automatically.
